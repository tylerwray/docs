For a ZEIT Now deployment to be created, our API requires the client to include a description of the project directory structure and content, expressed as a series of [checksums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum).

If our system finds a sourcefile checksum to be missing in our database, it will request the client to upload it and retry.

Next, our system decides if a **new** deployment is necessary, based on the project config and sources. If they match an existing deployment, we return its [Deployment URL](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/urls).

It is worth pointing out that there is no notion of **editing or modifying an existing deployment**. When you make a source or config change, a new deployment is always created.

#### Motivation

Immutability enables many important properties for scalable deployments and large teams / repositories.

#### Historical overview and rollbacks

When you run `now ls`, visit the Deployments List on our web UI, or browse through pull request or pushes made via our [GitHub integration](/docs/v2/advanced/now-for-github), all the deployments will continue to work concurrently.

This allows you to examine the evolution of a project over time. In addition, if a bug is detected, you can instantly roll back by changing the deployment associated with the [production domain](/docs/v2/custom-domains#deploying-with-your-domain).

#### Instant Git Reverts

With ZEIT Now + Github, if a PR is merged that yields an undesirable outcome, it should be quickly reverted. Similarly, one can revert a commit in any branch of a vanilla `git` repository.

Due to the [Now deduplication algorithm](#deduplication-algorithm), if a deployment existed in the past that matches the new source code state.

#### Improved Collaboration

Immutability enables projects with many different developers to be effectively deployable without any sort of inhibition.

There is no situation where the changes pushed or deployed by a certain individual or team will step over or overwrite others' changes.

#### Deduplication Algorithm

The [URL structure](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/urls) of each deployment contains in the **subdomain**, the name of the application and a random UID.

We decide to generate a new UID (and therefore a new deployment), by combining the following information into an internal digest that we look up in our database:

- The entire deployment configuration from `now.json`
- The owner ID (either the user ID or team ID, if deploying within a team)
- The description of the filesystem. This includes symlinks, [modes](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_(Unix)>), pathnames and the [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) of each file's contents

We ensure the digest is computed [deterministically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm) by sorting and ordering all the inputs involved in the algorithm.

Our lookup excludes deployments that are in an `ERROR` [state](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/lifecycle). If a previous deployment matches the digest but failed to build correctly.

#### Skipping deduplication

There are two ways to force a **new** deployment to be created when our system would otherwise deduplicate.

- **Make any change** to any of the parameters considered by the algorithm above. For example, even changing one character in a comment of a source file yields a new deployment.
- **Force a new deployment** by instructing your client to do so.
  - For [Now CLI](/download) you can run `now --force`
  - If using our API, include the [`forceNew` query parameter](/docs/api/v2#endpoints/deployments/create-a-new-deployment)
