| [Lifecycle](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/lifecycle)                                     | The lifecycle of a deployment determines its readiness to accept user requests and serve traffic. Read more about how deployments go through phases to ensure they are served with maximum potential. |
| [Immutability](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/immutability)                               | Now deployments are immutable. Read more about this concept to see how it helps scale projects.                                                                                                       |
| [URLs](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/urls)                                               | Now Deployments are always assigned their own unique and staging URLs. Read more about how they are formatted and how they work.                                                                      |
| [Special Paths](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/special-paths)                             | Now Deployments always have two special pathnames; `/_src` and `/_logs`. Read more about what they are and how they help with your deployments workflow.                                              |
| [Serverless Functions](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/serverless-functions)               | Now outputs dynamic files as Serverless Functions. Read more about how Serverless Functions work for your deployments and the benefits of serverless.                                                 |
