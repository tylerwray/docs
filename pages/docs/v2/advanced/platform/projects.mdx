A project is a logical structure that groups deployments and [custom domains](/docs/v2/custom-domains) inside of an account or team, based on the name of the project. This structure allows easier tracking and managing of deployments.

The projects structure enables faster locating of [deployments logs](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/special-paths#logs-view), [source code](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/special-paths#source-view), and [custom domains](/docs/v2/custom-domains).

## Creating a Project

A project can be created either from the ZEIT account or team dashboard, by using [Now CLI](/download), or automatically when [deploying](/docs/v2/build-step).

### 1. From the Dashboard

Simply visit [the ZEIT dashboard](/dashboard)(optionally selecting a team from the team picker), then click on the "Projects" link in the dashboard navigation.

Then, you can create a project by just giving it a name.

### 2. With Now CLI

You can create project by just typing the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now projects add <your-project-name>" />
<Caption>Creating a project with <GenericLink href="/now">Now CLI</GenericLink>.</Caption>

<Note>
  You need to download the latest version of Now CLI in order to run the above
  command.
</Note>

### 3. Automatic Project Creation

This is simplest way to create a project as it does not require any action from the user. A project will automatically be created when making a deployment using the [defined name](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/urls#deployment-name).

(To select a project for a deployment, check the following section)

## Selecting an Existing Project for a Deployment

When [deploying an app](/docs/v2/build-step), you can select an existing project for it. To do this, either:

### 1. Select the Project from Now CLI

Use the `--name` option to mention the project name as follows:

<Snippet dark text="now --name <your-project-name>" />
<Caption>Deploying the current directory with Now CLI and <InlineCode>--name</InlineCode> option.</Caption>

### 2. Automatic Project Selection

If you didn't specify a project name explicitly via one of the above methods, we try to select a project automatically based on following rules:

- If this is GitHub deployment, we use the GitHub repo name as the project
- If this is a [Now CLI](/download) based deployment, we use the directory name of your app as the project
- If this is a file or a set of files, we use the `files` project

## Deleting a Project

You can remove a project and all of the deployments contained within it with the following [Now CLI](/download) command:

<Snippet dark text="now projects rm <your-project-name>" />

<Note alert label="Note">
  This will also delete the deployments from the project. If you have any
  deployments that are assigned to a custom domain and do not want them to be
  removed, make sure to deploy and assign them to the custom domain under a
  different project first.
