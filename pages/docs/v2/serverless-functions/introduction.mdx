ZEIT Now deployments support various backend languages that you can deploy as Serverless functions.

## Deploying Serverless Functions

To deploy Serverless Functions without any additional configuration, you can put files with extensions matching [supported languages](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/supported-languages) and exported functions in the `api` directory at your project's root.

<Note>
  If you are using Next.js, use the <InlineCode>/pages/api</InlineCode>{' '}
  directory instead.
  <br />
  <GenericLink href="https://nextjs.org/docs#api-routes">
    Read more about API functionality with Next.js
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

Then, using [Now CLI](/download), run the following command to deploy from your terminal:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

### An Example Node.js Serverless Function

To deploy a [serverless Node.js API](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/supported-languages#node.js), provide a main export function like the following, in a `.js` file within the `api` directory:

```js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    body: req.body,
    query: req.query,
    cookies: req.cookies
  })
}
```

<Caption>

  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/serverless-functions/supported-languages#node.js-request-and-response-objects">
    Request and Response objects
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Caption>

The above example echoes the `body`, path `query`, and `cookie`s, passed with the request object, as a JSON object using helper methods provided through the [Request and Response](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/supported-languages/#node.js-request-and-response-objects).

Then, all you need to do, to have a live API, is deploy with [Now CLI](/download) from your terminal:

<Snippet dark text="now" />
<Caption>One-command deployment with <GenericLink href="/download">Now CLI</GenericLink>.</Caption>

The resulting deployment will contain your Node.js Serverless Function and will provide you with a URL like the following, with your API ready to go: <https://node-echo-api.now-examples.now.sh/api/?name=zeit>

### More Examples and Supported Languages

For all supported languages, see the [Supported Languages for Severless Functions documentation](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/supported-languages).

More examples of applications you can deploy paired with Serverless Functions can be found in the [ZEIT Now examples repository on GitHub](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples).

You can use any of the Now examples by using the following command from [Now CLI](/download) in your terminal, then choosing an application to start with:

<Snippet dark text="now init" />

## Prevent Endpoint Listing

By default, all files inside of the `/api` directory will be made available as Serverless Functions.

If this behavior is not desired, for example you want a utilities folder inside of the `/api` directory, you can prefix files or folders with either `_` or `.` to prevent them from being created as Serverless Functions.

Therefore, if you keep your utility functions inside of `/api/_utils`, none of them will be created as Serverless Functions. This is because the parent folder is prefixed with `_`.

If you kept your utility functions inside of `/api/utils`, one called `date.js` and the other `_time.js`, only `date.js` would be created as a Serverless Function.

## Path Segments

Deploying Serverless Functions with ZEIT Now gives you the ability to use path segments through file names instead of a complex routes file.

Creating a file using any of the [supported languages](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/supported-languages) in the `api` directory and wrapping the filename in square brackets, such as `[name].js` will provide you with a file that takes a path segment and gives it to the function when requested with a value.

For example, creating a `name` directory (within `/api`) with a `[name].js` file will allow you to receive the path segment entered when accessing `/api/name/your-name`.

The following Node.js example code could then use the path segment in its functionality when requested:

```js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  const {
    query: { name }
  } = req

  res.send(`Hello ${name}!`)
}
```

<Note>
  Any{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/serverless-functions/supported-languages">

  </GenericLink>{' '}
  can utilize path segments.
</Note>

## Local Development

ZEIT Now provides an additional command with [Now CLI](/download) to help you develop Serverless Functions locally by replicating the production environment on Now with your localhost.

If you have an `api` directory like the [above examples](#deploying-serverless-functions) on this page, you can run the following command to start a local development environment that supports your serverless API and allows you to develop locally, just make sure to install your project's dependencies first with `npm install`:

<Snippet dark text="now dev" />
<Caption>Starting a local development environment using Now CLI, for Serverless Functions.</Caption>

<Note>
  The <InlineCode>now dev</InlineCode> command is still in beta. If you have any
  feedback,{' '}
  <GenericLink href="https://zeit.co/feedback/dev">
    please let us know
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

If you have a statically generated frontend that supports its own development environment, such as Next.js, we recommend creating a `dev` script within a `package.json` file at the root of your project that `now dev` can use and extend:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next --port $PORT"
  }
}
```

<Caption>

</Caption>

<Note>
  The above script example uses <InlineCode>--port $PORT</InlineCode> in the{' '}
  <InlineCode>dev</InlineCode> command. This uses the framework's – in this case
  Next.js – port argument to pass the port from <InlineCode>now dev</InlineCode>{' '}
  so that it can properly fetch the running framework.
</Note>

### Using Environment Variables Locally

During local development with `now dev`, you may wish to provide your application with environment variables. You can find instructions on how to do this in the [environment variables and secrets section](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/env-and-secrets/#during-local-development).

## Advanced Usage

For an advanced configuration and structure, you can create a `now.json` file to define [Builds](/docs/v2/advanced/builders/overview) and other customizations.

We do, however, recommend using the `api` directory to keep things simple for your project.
