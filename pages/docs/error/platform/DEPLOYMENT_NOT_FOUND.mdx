#### Troubleshoot

- Make sure the link you accessed is correct.
- If you were expecting a deployment to be assigned to a domain that you are accessing, please ensure that the domain is [assigned to a project](/docs/v2/custom-domains/#adding-a-domain) and there is a [production deployment](/docs/v2/custom-domains/#deploying-with-your-domain).
- If the link is correct and you were not expecting this error; **[Contact Support](mailto:support@zeit.co)**.
