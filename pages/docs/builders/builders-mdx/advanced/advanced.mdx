# Advanced Usage

<Note warning>
  Using Builders in advanced configuration will disable the zero configuration
  functionality of ZEIT Now.
</Note>

If your project has source files that need to be built requiring a different structure than Now provides by default, you can use Builders with advanced configuration to achieve that structure.

Builders can be used with Now by creating a `now.json` file in a project and then [using a `builds` property](/docs/configuration#project/builds) within that configuration:

```json
{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*.html", "use": "@now/static" },
    { "src": "date.js", "use": "@now/node" }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file using build steps.
</Caption>

The `builds` property is an array of objects where each object is a build step, including a `src` and a `use` property, at least.

The Builder will receive a list of files based on the `src` property's [glob](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) value.

<Note>
  It is important to remember that the <InlineCode>src</InlineCode> property is
  a glob. In the above example, this will only use the Static Builder for the
  HTML files in the root directory. If you need it to be used throughout
  subdirectories, you need the appropriate glob syntax:{' '}
  <InlineCode>**/*.html</InlineCode>.
</Note>

The `use` property of a build step can contain the name of a Builder module published to npm. For example, the following list contains the Official Builders and their module names to use.

| Builder      | Builder Module      |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Static       | `@now/static`       |
| Static Build | `@now/static-build` |
| Node.js      | `@now/node`         |
| Next.js      | `@now/next`         |
| Go           | `@now/go`           |
| Python       | `@now/python`       |
| Ruby         | `@now/ruby`         |

Since Builders are published to [npm](https://npmjs.com), the `use` statement in your [`now.json` file](/docs/configuration) uses a similar syntax to `npm install`, meaning that versioning can be used by tagging the builders, like for example:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "api/**/*.js", "use": "@now/node@0.12.3" }]
}
```

## Community Builders

The following is a list of community maintained Builders.

| Builder | Builder Module | Docs                                     |
| ------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| PHP     | `now-php`      | <https://github.com/juicyfx/now-php>     |
| Rust    | `now-rust`     | <https://github.com/mike-engel/now-rust> |

<Note>
  If you need to create a custom Builder, see the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="#advanced-usage/developing-your-own-builder">
    Developing Your Own Builder section
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

## Advanced Static Builds Usage

<Note alert>
  The following configuration step will disable the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/introduction">
    zero configuration nature
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  of ZEIT Now, and you will have to define build steps for all source files that
  you intend to serve from your deployments.
</Note>

You can configure your own build step using the Static Builds Builder by providing configuration like the following, inside of a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that lists a build step
  using the Static Builds Builder.
</Caption>

**The entry point for `src` must be a `package.json` file** with a `build` script that, when executed, compiles the built application into a `public` directory.

### Configuring the Build Output Directory with Static Builds Builder

If you want to configure a directory other than `public` for your build output, you can pass an optional `distDir` option in the builder's config:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@now/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "www" }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that uses the Static Builds
  Builder with a configured output directory.
</Caption>

### Shell File Entry Point for Static Builds

Using a file with a `.sh` file extension as an entry point for the `@now/static-build` Builder allows you to define build instructions in a shell file.

For example, creating a shell file, with the name `build.sh`, with the following contents, will install and build a [Hugo project](https://zeit.co/guides/deploying-hugo-with-now/):

```shell
curl -L -O https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.55.6/hugo_0.55.6_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
tar -xzf hugo_0.55.6_Linux-64bit.tar.gz

./hugo
```

<Caption>
  An example shell file that installs and builds a Hugo project.
</Caption>

For depencency installation with [shell file entry points](#advanced-usage/advanced-static-builds-usage/shell-file-entry-point-for-static-builds), `yum` is available.

### Private npm Modules for Static Builds

To install private npm modules, define `NPM_TOKEN` as a [build environment variable](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) in a `now.json` file.

Alternatively, define `NPM_RC` as a [build environment variable](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) with the contents of `~/.npmrc`.

## Advanced Node.js Usage

<Note alert>
  The following configuration step will disable the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction">
    zero configuration nature
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  of ZEIT Now, and you will have to define build steps for all source files that
  you intend to serve from your deployments.
</Note>

You can configure your own build step using the Node.js Builder, to compile Node.js source files into Serverless Functions, by providing configuration like the following, inside of a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.js", "use": "@now/node" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that lists a build step
  using the Node.js Builder.
</Caption>

**The entry point for `src` must be a glob matching `.js` or `.ts` files** that export a default function. For more information on using this Builder, [see the Node.js Builder section](#official-builders/node-js).

### Disabling Helpers for Node.js

Within a `now.json` configuration file at your project's root, use the following build step with config to disable [helpers](#official-builders/node-js/node-js-request-and-response-objects).

```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "my-file.js",
      "use": "@now/node",
      "config": { "helpers": "false" }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that has a build step using
  the Node.js Builder with configuration.
</Caption>

### Private npm Modules for Node.js

To install private npm modules, define `NPM_TOKEN` as a [build environment variable](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) in `now.json`.

Alternatively, define `NPM_RC` as a [build environment variable](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) with the contents of `~/.npmrc`.

### Custom Build Step for Node.js

You can run build tasks by creating a `now-build` script within a `package.json` file at the entry point's level or higher. For example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "now-build": "node ./build.js"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file with a{' '}
  <InlineCode>now-build</InlineCode> script to execute in the build step.
</Caption>

Along with build script named `build.js`:

```js
const fs = require('fs')
fs.writeFile('built-time.js', (module.exports = '${new Date()}'), err => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log('Build time file created successfully!')
})
```

<Caption>
  An example Node.js file, executed by the above{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> build script.
</Caption>

And a `.js` file for the built Serverless Functions, `index.js` inside the `/api` directory:

```js
const BuiltTime = require('./built-time')
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('content-type', 'text/plain')
  res.send(`
    This Serverless Function was built at ${new Date(BuiltTime)}.
    The current time is ${new Date()}
  `)
}
```

<Caption>
  An example Node.js Serverless Function, using information from the created
  file from the build script.
</Caption>

### Legacy Serverful Behavior

A Node.js Builder entrypoint can contain one of the following to retain legacy serverful behavior:

- Default export server, such as `module.exports = http.createServer((req, res) => { res.end('hello') })`.
- Server listens on a port, such as `http.createServer((req, res) => { res.end('hello') }).listen(3000)`.

### AWS Lambda API

The Node.js Builder provides a `config.awsLambdaHandler` to opt into the [AWS Lambda API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-handler.html). This is useful if you have existing functions you wish to deploy to ZEIT Now but do not want to change the API.

```js
exports.handler = async function() {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: {},
    body: 'Hello world'
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  A file <InlineCode>index.js</InlineCode> that exports a{' '}
  <InlineCode>handler</InlineCode> function.
</Caption>

You can deploy this function with the following `now.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "index.js",
      "use": "@now/node",
      "config": { "awsLambdaHandler": "index.handler" }
    }
  ]
```

<Caption>
  The <InlineCode>awsLambdaHandler</InlineCode> configuration must match the
  file name followed by the exported function name.
</Caption>

The `awsLambdaHandler` uses the same syntax as [AWS Handler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-create-deployment-pkg.html) which is the file name and the exported function name.

## Advanced Next.js Usage

<Note alert>
  The following configuration step will disable the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/introduction">
    zero configuration nature
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  of ZEIT Now, and you will have to define build steps for all source files that
  you intend to serve from your deployments.
</Note>

You can configure your own build step using the Next.js Builder, to compile Next.js source files into Serverless Functions, by providing configuration like the following, inside of a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/next" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that lists a build step
  using the Next.js Builder.
</Caption>

**The entry point of this Builder** is a `package.json` file with Next.js 9 or newer defined in `dependencies`. For more information on using this Builder, [see the Next.js Builder section](#official-builders/next-js).

For more information on this, see [the Next.js documentation](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#serverless-deployment).

### Private npm Modules for Next.js

To install private npm modules, define `NPM_TOKEN` as a [build environment variable](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) in `now.json`.

Alternatively, define `NPM_RC` as a [build environment variable](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) with the contents of `~/.npmrc`.

### Environment Variables with Next.js

To support environment variables, Next.js inlines the provided values into the JavaScript bundle at build.

You can add the `env` key to the `next.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  env: {
    customKey: process.env.customKey,
    mySecret: process.env.mySecret
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>next.config.js</InlineCode> file.
</Caption>

Then, [expose the build env](/docs/v2/deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets) in your `now.json`:

```json
{
  ...
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "customKey": "value",
      "mySecret": "@my-secret-name"
    }
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file specifying a build
  environment variable.
</Caption>

This will allow you to use `process.env.customKey` and `process.env.mySecret` in your code.

</Note>

You can configure your own build step using the Go Builder, to compile Go source files into Serverless Functions, by providing configuration like the following, inside of a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.go", "use": "@now/go" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that lists a build step

</Caption>

**The entry point of this Builder is a global matching `.go` files** that export a function that implements the `http.HandlerFunc` signature. For more information on using this Builder, [see the Go Builder section](#official-builders/go).

### Private Packages for Go

To install private packages with `go get`, define `GIT_CREDENTIALS` as a [build environment variable](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) in `now.json`.

All major Git providers are supported including GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, as well as a self-hosted Git server.

With GitHub, you will need to [create a personal token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with permission to access your private repository.

```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "GIT_CREDENTIALS": "https://username:token@github.com"
    }
  }
}
```

<Caption>

You can configure your own build step using the Python Builder, to compile Python source files into Serverless Functions, by providing configuration like the following, inside of a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.py", "use": "@now/python" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that lists a build step
  using the Python Builder.
</Caption>

**The entry point of this Builder is a glob matching `.py` source files** with one of the following variables defined:

- `handler` that inherits from the `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` class.
- `app` that exposes a WSGI or ASGI Application.

### Web Server Gateway Interface

The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a calling convention for web servers to forward requests to web applications written in Python. You can use WSGI with frameworks such as Flask or Django.

Instead of defining a `handler`, define an `app` variable in your Python file, when using `now.json` config. For example, define a `index.py` file inside your project as follows:

```python
from flask import Flask, Response
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', defaults={'path': ''})
@app.route('/<path:path>')
def catch_all(path):
    return Response("<h1>Flask on Now</h1><p>You visited: /%s</p>" % (path), mimetype="text/html")
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.py</InlineCode> file, using Flask for a WSGI
  application.
</Caption>

Inside `requirements.txt` define:

```
flask==1.0.2
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>requirements.txt</InlineCode> file, listing{' '}
  <InlineCode>flask</InlineCode> as a dependency.
</Caption>

### Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface

The Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) is a calling convention for web servers to forward requests to asynchronous web applications written in Python. You can use ASGI with frameworks such as [Sanic](https://sanic.readthedocs.io).

Instead of defining a `handler`, define an `app` variable in your Python file.

For example, define a `index.py` file inside a folder as follows:

```python
from sanic import Sanic
from sanic.response import json
app = Sanic()


@app.route('/')
@app.route('/<path:path>')
async def index(request, path=""):
    return json({'hello': path})
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.py</InlineCode> file, using Sanic for a ASGI
  application.
</Caption>

Inside `requirements.txt` define:

```
sanic==19.6.0
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>requirements.txt</InlineCode> file, listing{' '}
  <InlineCode>sanic</InlineCode> as a dependency.

You can configure your own build step using the Ruby Builder, to compile Ruby source files into Serverless Functions, by providing configuration like the following, inside of a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.rb", "use": "@now/ruby" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that lists a build step
  using the Ruby Builder.
</Caption>

**The entry point of this Builder is a glob matching `.rb` or `.ru` (for [Rack](#advanced-usage/advanced-ruby-usage/rack-interface)) source files** with one of the following variables defined:

- `Handler` proc that matches the `do |req, res|` signature.
- `Handler` class that inherits from the `WEBrick::HTTPServlet::AbstractServlet` class.

For more information on using this Builder, [see the Ruby Builder section](#official-builders/ruby).

Alternatively, [a `.ru` Rack config file](#advanced-usage/advanced-ruby-usage/rack-interface) will serve the Ruby application it contains.

### Rack Interface

Many Ruby frameworks interface with [Rack](https://rack.github.io/) for forwarding HTTP requests to web applications written in Ruby. You can use Rack with frameworks such as Sinatra or Rails.

Instead of defining a handler, write the application as usual, like this Sinatra application:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/*' do
    'Hello world'
end
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>Sinatra</InlineCode> application.

Inside `Gemfile` define:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "sinatra", "~> 2.0"
gem "rack", "~> 2.0"
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>Gemfile</InlineCode> file.
</Caption>

Add a Rack config file at `index.ru` to start the application:

```ruby
require './app'

run Sinatra::Application
```

## Developing Your Own Builder

Extending the feature-set of a ZEIT Now deployment is as simple as creating a Builder that takes a list of files and outputs either static files or dynamic [Serverless Functions](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/serverless-functions).

[A full API reference is available to help with creating Builders.](https://github.com/zeit/now/blob/canary/DEVELOPING_A_BUILDER.md)

---

## Technical Details

### Caching Data

A builder can retain an archive of up to `100mb` of the filesystem at `build` time. The cache key is generated as a combination of:

- Project name.
- Team id or user id.
- Entrypoint path (e.g., `api/users/index.go`).
- Builder identifier including version (e.g.: `@now/go@0.0.1`).

The cache will be invalidated if any of those items changes. The user can bypass the cache by running `now -f`.

### Limits

- Builders can run for a maximum of 5 minutes before the execution times out.
- The maximum cache archive size of a Builder is 100mb.
- The cache TTL is 7 days.

### Including Additional Files

Most Builders use static analysis to determine which source files should be included in the Serverless Function output based on the build `src` input. Any unused code or assets is ignored to ensure your Serverless Function is as small as possible.

For example, the Node Builder looks at calls to `require()` or `fs.readFile()` in order to determine which files to include automatically.

<Code lang="javascript">{`// index.js
const { readFileSync } = require('fs');
const { join } = require('path');
const file = readFileSync(join(__dirname, 'config', 'ci.yml'), 'utf8');
`}</Code>
<Caption>
    This <InlineCode>/index.js</InlineCode> file reads the contents of{' '}
    <InlineCode>/config/ci.yml</InlineCode>.<br />
    The use of <InlineCode>__dirname</InlineCode> is necessary to read a file relative
    to the current file.
  </Caption>

In some cases, you may wish to include templates or views that are not able to be statically analyzed. Builders provide a configuration for `includeFiles` that accepts an array of globs that will always be included in the Serverless Functions output.

<Code lang="json">{`{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "index.js",
      "use": "@now/node",
      "config": {
        "includeFiles": [
          "templates/**",
          "views/**"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}`}</Code>
