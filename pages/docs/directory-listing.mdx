The Directory Listing page, which shows the contents within a directory, is served when a particular path is both a directory and does not have an index file within it.

### Disabling The Directory Listing

To prevent showing a Directory Listing page, add an index file, such as `index.html`, which will then show that file instead when accessing the directory's path.

If you were expecting a file to be here, check your Build output from the Deployment Overview from your [ZEIT Dashboard](/dashboard).

#### Custom 404

Using advanced configuration, you can also implement [a custom 404 page](/docs/configuration#routes/advanced/custom-404) in place of a Directory Listing.

export default ({ children }) => <Standard meta={meta}>{children}</Standard>

export const config = {
  amp: 'hybrid'
}
