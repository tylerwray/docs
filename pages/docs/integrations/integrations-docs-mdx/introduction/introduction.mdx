# Introduction

## ZEIT Integrations

ZEIT Integrations introduce a way to **extend the capabilities of ZEIT** and to connect with **any platform**.

The following is just some the things you can do with ZEIT Integrations:

- Add databases into deployments with just a few clicks.
- Add custom UI elements to the [ZEIT Dashboard](/).
- Complete access to the [ZEIT API](/docs/api).
- Configure third-party services such as error tracking and performance monitoring.
- Create mashup apps by connecting multiple different services of your choosing.
- Access hardware and connect with external devices such Arduino, Philips Hue, etc.

These are **just a few of the possibilities** afforded by ZEIT Integrations. This page will walk you through on how to create your own to do more with ZEIT.

<Note hint>
