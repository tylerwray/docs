## Project-Based Environment Variables

When building a ZEIT Integration, you may want to expose an API secret or a configuration URL for deployments within a project.

For example, say you want to expose the `MONGO_URL` environment variable; the following would be the process to do so:

- Create a secret to store the value for `MONGO_URL` (This is an account wide operation). For this example, we'll assume the value for the secret key is `mongo_url_for_my_db`.
- Next, add `MONGO_URL=@mongo_url_for_my_db` for the projects where `MONGO_URL` is needed.

<Note>
  The pattern is to create a secret once per account then use it many times with
  different projects.
