## Information

### Project Information

Inside the ZEIT Dashboard, a user can access different configurations for an Integration inside either:

- The team or user dashboard
- Each and every project

A UIHook can identify this by looking at the `payload.project` property. It can then change the user interface selectively.

<Note>
  If the user is looking at a configurations inside the main dashboard,{' '}
  <InlineCode>payload.project</InlineCode> will be empty.
</Note>

### Account Information

You can access the account information of the installation inside the UIHook. Here's a list of such properties:

- `payload.user` - The `user` who is accessing the UIHook
- `payload.team` - The `team` of the configuration if the Integration is added into a team, otherwise empty
