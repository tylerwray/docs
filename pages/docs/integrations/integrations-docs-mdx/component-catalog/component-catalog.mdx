# Component Catalog

To enable the rapid development of Integrations whilst providing a safe and secure environment for all, we have created a component catalog for you to use.

The following components can be used to construct your UIHook's:

## Page

This is the root of your UIHook. All other components should live inside the `Page` component.

```jsx
<Page>Some other components</Page>
```

<ActionComponents />
<InputComponents />
<UiComponents />
