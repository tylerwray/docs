# Using the Metadata Store

When installing an Integration, most of the time it will need to persist different configurations and information.

This may include but is not limited to:

- User preferences
- Different API secrets/tokens
- Cached results for faster access

Usually, a database is used to persist this information, but for ZEIT Integrations, we provide a Metadata Store for this very purpose.

Every [UIHook](#creating-an-integration/step-2-creating-a-uihook) has access to a Metadata Store.

Each configuration of the Integration gets its own Metadata Store. It is limited to 100KB in size for a single configuration.

It's very common to load metadata inside the UIHook for every request. That's why we limit its size to 100KB. With that, we strike the balance between a generous amount of storage and lightning fast loading times.

If you need more storage capacity, we recommend using an external database.
