## Domain Errors

These error code could happen when using any [domains related endpoints](#endpoints/domains).

### Domain Forbidden

You don't have access to the domain, this usually mean this domains is owned by another account or team.

The domain is specified in the message and the `DOMAIN` key.

<Example>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
    "error": {

  }`}</Code>
</Example>

  <Code lang="json">{`{
    "error": {
      "code": "not_found",
      "message": "Domain name not found"
    }
  }`}</Code>
</Example>

### Missing Domain Name

The domain name wasn't specified in the URL. This means you tried to use an endpoint which require you to define the domain name in the URL but didn't defined it.
