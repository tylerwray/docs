# Getting Started

## Introduction

The <Now color="#000" /> API gives full control over the entire Now platform by providing all the resources available to [our official clients](/download), exposed as simple HTTP endpoints.

The following example deploys a monorepo with a static file, served through our CDN, and a serverless request handler in Node.js. This example makes use of these simple API endpoints.

Use the editor to play with the HTML, CSS, and JS files to see how Now handles them in deployment. Click "Deploy to Now" or copy and paste the `curl` command into your terminal to deploy.

You can use the other commands with `curl` by providing your testing token found [here](/account/tokens).
